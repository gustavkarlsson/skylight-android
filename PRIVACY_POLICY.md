Skylight is an Open Source mobile application created by Gustav Karlsson. It is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone using the app.

If you choose to use the app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the app. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.


## How your data is used

This section explains the different cases where your data may be collected, and where it is sent.

### Error reporting

To improve the stability and user experience of the app, errors may be reported to a third party service as they occur. This data may include information such as your device model, operating system, and current IP address.

The data is sent to Firebase Crashlytics ([privacy policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)).

### Looking up location names

In order to determine the name of your current location, the app will send your location data to a third party service. This will only happen if you have granted the app access to your location.

The data is sent to Google ([privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).

### Looking up location coordinates

If you choose to manually add a location, the app will send your location search terms to a third party service to find the coordinates of that location.

The data is sent to Mapbox ([privacy policy](https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy)).

### Looking up weather information

To determine the chances of seeing the Aurora, the app will check the weather based on your current location (or a location you have added manually).

The data is sent to OpenWeatherMap ([privacy policy](https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy)).

### Checking aurora conditions

To determine the chances of seeing the Aurora, the app will connect to an internet service which temporarily collects your IP address for logging purposes.

The data is sent to Heroku ([privacy policy](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security)) and Papertrail ([privacy policy](https://www.papertrail.io/privacy)).

### Checking for updates

To ensure that the app works reliably, it may sometimes check for updates to certain components. Checking for updates will share your IP address.

The data is sent to Google ([privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).


## Location data

As described above, the app may collect your location data and share it with third party services over the internet. This is necessary if you wish the app to automatically use your current location instead of a manually chosen location. If you wish to get notifications for your current location while the app is not running, the app needs to track your location in the background. Collecting location data requires your opt-in and can be revoked at any time.


## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.


## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2022-03-20
