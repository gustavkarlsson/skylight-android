    <string name="factor_geomag_location_desc">The aurora is only visible close to
        the geomagnetic poles located close to the magnetic north and south poles.
        This value shows your geomagnetic latitude.
        The best latitude for aurora sightings is around 67° and -67°.</string>

    <string name="factor_kp_index_title_compact">Kp index</string>
    <string name="factor_kp_index_desc">The basic cause of the aurora involves the
        interaction of the solar wind with the Earth\'s magnetosphere.
        This can be represented as a value on the Kp index scale, ranging from
        0 to 9. A higher value means higher chance to see the aurora.</string>

        the position of the sun is important.
        This value shows how dark your current location is based on the sun\'s position.
        100\% darkness is perfect for aurora sightings.</string>
