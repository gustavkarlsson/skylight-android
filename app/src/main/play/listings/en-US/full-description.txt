Skylight helps you spot auroras by notifying you when conditions are good.

Conditions are based on 4 factors:
- Kp index
- Location
- Visibility due to weather
- Outdoor darkness

Because of this, you will not get notifications in broad daylight or on your vacation in Spain, but only when there is a REAL chance of seeing the aurora.

The app is designed to be non-intrusive. You can use it to check manually, but the best way is to just turn on notifications to let the app do the work for you.

I Hope you enjoy it :)
