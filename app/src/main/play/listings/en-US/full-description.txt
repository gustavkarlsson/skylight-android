Skylight helps you spot auroras by notifying you when conditions are good.

Conditions are based on 4 factors:
- Kp index
- Location
- Visibility due to weather
- Outdoor darkness

Because of this, you will not get notifications in broad daylight or on your vacation in Spain, but only when there is a REAL chance of seeing the aurora.

I Hope you enjoy it :)
